* Task 1 : Prediction using Supervised ML

* Linear regression : Linear regression is a linear model, e.g. a model that assumes a linear relationship between the input variables (x) and the single output variable (y).

* Supervised ML : Supervised Machine Learning is a method where the models are trained using labeled data, it needs supervision to train the model.

* We used a Linear Regression Model to predict the score of a student if he/she studies for 9.25 hours/day and the Predicted Score came out to be 93.69.
